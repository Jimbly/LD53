LD53 - TBD
============================

Ludum Dare 53 Entry by Jimbly - "Unnamed"

* Play here: [dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD53/](http://www.dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD53/)
* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

Plan: Mini-metro Factories  "Mini-Factory"?
* factories: sources, converters, sinks
* scrollable play area
* currency/inventory display in upper right
* click node, then another node to add a delivery route (up to limit)
* click button on route to upgrade or downgrade/cancel
* buy things (just more routes and upgrades and victory) in panel on the right (no undo)
* click unactivated factory to spend cost and activate it (no undo)
NO  * this also adds additional routes and upgrades, I think
NO * click button on factory to upgrade
* maybe: disable any node to turn it into storage/routing instead of a factory (flip card over visually?)
